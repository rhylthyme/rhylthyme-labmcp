r"""Checks applied to raw SCPI text *before* anything is sent to the instrument.

A generic SCPI server lets the model compose arbitrary commands, so the server
itself cannot know which ones are dangerous. This module enforces what it can:

* ``scpi_query`` (a READ tool, available in ``--read-only`` mode) only accepts a
  *single query*: one program message unit whose header ends in ``?``, with no
  ``;`` and no control characters. Queries known to have side effects
  (``*TST?``, ``*CAL?``, ``CALibration...?``, ``DIAGnostic...?``) and anything
  matching ``--option query_denylist`` are refused and must go through
  ``scpi_write``, which the MCP client asks the user to confirm.
* ``--option write_denylist=REGEX`` is never sent by any tool.
* ``--option write_allowlist=REGEX``, when set, is the only thing ``scpi_write``,
  ``scpi_batch`` and ``reset_instrument`` may send (apart from queries that
  ``scpi_query`` would accept).

Patterns are Python regular expressions, matched case-insensitively with
``re.search`` against every message unit in two forms: the text as sent
(upper-cased, whitespace collapsed, leading colon removed) and a normalised
form in which every header mnemonic is reduced to its SCPI short form, e.g.
``:OUTPut1:STATe ON`` becomes ``OUTP1:STAT ON`` (SCPI-99 Vol. 1, 6.2.1
"Mnemonic Generation Rules"). Write patterns against the short form and they
also catch the long form.

SCPI booleans accept any number (SCPI-99 Vol. 1 ch. 7, Boolean: rounded, non-zero is ON),
so deny "everything but OFF" rather than listing the ON spellings:
``^OUTP\d*(:STAT)? (?!OFF\b)`` also refuses ``OUTP 2``, ``OUTP 1.0`` and ``OUTP #H1``.
